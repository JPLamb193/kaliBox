# kaliBox
My first attempt at a headless raspberry pi “ssh box” running kali linux.

ARGON ONE RPI CASE FAN SCRIPTS WILL BRICK KALI. Requires further research.

ParrotOS does not seem to have a version on their website that supports RPI (more specifically RPI4). Will need to research.

Specifications:

 Argon ONE V2 Raspberry Pi 4 case - $25
      
  Raspberry Pi 4 Model B 2019 4GB - $100
        
SanDisk 32GB Extreme MicroSD Card - $10
       
 Kali Linux with SSH service configured - $0
