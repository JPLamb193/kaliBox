# kaliBox
##My first attempt at a headless raspberry pi “ssh box” running kali linux.

ARGON ONE RPI CASE FAN SCRIPTS WILL BRICK KALI. Requires further research.

ParrotOS does not seem to have a version on their website that supports RPI (more specifically RPI4). Will need to research.

  -ParrotOS seems to have discontinued ARM support back in Parrot version 3

Specifications:

 Argon ONE V2 Raspberry Pi 4 case - $25

  Raspberry Pi 4 Model B 2019 4GB - $100

SanDisk 32GB Extreme MicroSD Card - $10

 Kali Linux with SSH service configured - $0
